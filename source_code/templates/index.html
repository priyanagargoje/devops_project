    <h1>Welcome to the Stuttered Speech Recognition API</h1>
    <p>This API provides a machine learning model that specializes in recognizing and analyzing stuttered speech patterns.</p>
    <p>If you're building an application or service that requires stuttered speech recognition capabilities, you've come to the right place!</p>
    <p>Make sure to refer to the API documentation for instructions on how to interact with the API and send audio data for analysis.</p>
    <p>For any inquiries or support, please contact at email 'ruthvikshinde553@gmail.com'.</p>
    <p>you can send a post request over "url in the browser/process" to try out the model.</p>
